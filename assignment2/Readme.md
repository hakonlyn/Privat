| Subject: 		| DAT240 Advanced Programming 		|
| Deadline:		| Sep 17 2019 23:59			|
| Expected effort:	| 10-15 hours 				|
| Grading: 		| Pass/fail 				|
| Submission: 		| Individually				|


## Introduction

The overall aim of the labs in this course is to learn how to develop applications,
deploy them as APIs and microservices. We will do this through a series of
lab exercises that will expose you to developing an application in the Java programming language, and some of
the tools that people frequently use to develop and deploy such applications. 

In Assignment 2 you will work on object oriented programming and File I/O operations.



To see the assignment2 in your local directory first run:
```git pull origin master.```



**Exercise 1 - Reading files in Java: (20% points)**

Change directory to: cd assignments/assignment2 and confirm that the files for assignment2 resides in that folder. They should, assuming that you followed the steps above. The file under assignment2/src/main/java/assignment2/ImageLabelReader.java contains the following skeleton code:

```
package assignment1;

public class ImageLabelReader {
     	  
	public long getFibonacci(long number) {
		
	}
}

```

 Implement the function body according to the specification. 
 
 **Exercise 2 - Inheritance: (40% points)**
 

 
  **Exercise 3 - TBD: (40% points)**
 
 
  
For all exercises we have some unit tests but you should write more unit tests using junit to make sure it works and thorough coverage.

Once you are done changing to submit follow instructions below:

- If you haven't already added a remote, run ```git remote add dat240labs https://github.com/uis-dat240-fall19/username-labs``` where username should be replaced with your own GitHub username and dat240labs can be replaced with any name you prefer.
- After you have made the changes commit them with ```git commit -m "Comment"``` and run ```git push dat240labs``` to have the changes pushed up to your own username-labs repository on GitHub. Note that you cloned the original repository but pushing to your own private repository.
- If you make changes to your own username-labs repository using the GitHub web interface, and want to pull those changes down to your own computer, you can run the command:
```git pull dat240labs master```
