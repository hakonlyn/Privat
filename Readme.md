# Grading and Collaboration Policy

All the lab exercises must be completed to satisfaction (passed)
in order to sit for the exam. The final exam accounts for 60 % of
the final grade in the course, while the project grade accounts for
the remaining 40 %. For the graded part of the lab, you will be
given a grade in the range 0-100 points, which will be translated
to a letter grade in the end, after the lab exam.

## Plagiarism Warning

Any form of cheating, plagiarism, i.e. copying of another student’s
text or source code, will result in the grade F, and may be reported
to the university for administrative processing. Committing acts that
violate Student Conduct policies that result in course disruption are
cause for suspension or dismissal from UiS.

*Don’t cheat. It’s not worth it!*

## Slip Days

No slip days. Extension only possible based on sick note or official reasons.

## Approval Process

Once you have passed the necessary tests for approval/grading of one of
the labs *you must* come to the lab (E456) and demonstrate/show your
code. *This is a requirement for approval.*

## Labs

#### Labs 1 - 3:
The first three lab handins are mainly preparatory, and doing a good job on
these is important for the remaining part of lab. *They must be completed
individually.* We do encourage collaboration on learning the material, e.g.
pointing each other in the right direction and giving hints and tips, but *we
do not accept joint handins* on these first five labs. You may discuss the
assignments with others, but you may not copy answers or code from another
student or make your code available to others. These labs will *not be graded*,
but must be completed to at least the level of passing (>80 points per lab).
You will not be told your grade points, only pass/fail.

#### Project:
The project handin will will require a
significant amount of work in groups. We expect students to form groups and work together
on this lab handin. For this lab handin the passing level will also be > 60
points per lab. We will evaluate each handin separately and give the group a
joint grade per lab. **The final lab grade will be determined by the oral
examination/demo in the lab. The oral exam will be conducted group/individually.**
